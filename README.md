# VirtualTourist
## Udacity.com ios Nanodegree project 4
Swift Language Version: Swift 5<br/>
Xcode Version: 11.3.1

## Application Description
The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.ded to a specific location, and a URL.

## From this project, I have learned to:
Use URLSessions to interact with a public restful API<br/>
Create a user interface that intuitively communicates network activity and download progress<br/>
Store media on the device file system<br/>
Use Core Data for local persistence of an object structure
